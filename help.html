  <h1>How to play</h1>
  <p>In the top box, a portion of the opening paragraph of a random Wikipedia page is shown. The object is to find the name of the artice in 3 guesses.<br>Each guess reveals 200 more charecters from the page, and any letters you guessed correctly.<br>It's litterally a Wordle clone, the mechanics aren't complex.<br>You aren't expected to know all of the pages, so reaserch may be required.</p>
